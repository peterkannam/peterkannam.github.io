Hello! I am a professional environmental geologist and data scientist working for Tetra Tech. The focus of my work is... I primarily support the following projects:

- *Chicago Cumulative Impact Assessment; Data and Methods Working Group* for the Chicago Department of Public Health
- *Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team* for Region 5 of the US EPA Region 5
- *Navajo Abandoned Uranium Mines; Response, Assessment, and Evaluation Services* for US EPA Region 9

For an example of my work, I would suggest  [`CompoisteIndicators.jl`](https://github.com/peterkannam/CompositeIndicators.jl?tab=readme-ov-file#compositeindicatorsjl): a package I wrote in [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/).

## Professional Experience

My foundation in data science has provided me with unique opportunities during my time at TetraTech. I have developed technical expertise in field instrumentation as well as the analysis and visualization of their results. This expertise has allowed me to participate in varied statisical studies which has given me perspectice on how different government entities and communities engage with environmental health issues.

### Emergency Responder - Air Monitoring and Telemetry Specialist

As a memeber of the *Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team* I was specialist in quickly establishing effective air monitoring networks during environmental distasters. This involved the deployment and maintience of air monitoring instruments, using network specific devices to connect instruments to telemetry software, and using that software to push synced data to relevent servers. 

Telemety was primarily established using the [Viper](https://response.epa.gov/site/site_profile.aspx?site_id=5033) software developed by US EPA, and required the manipulation of insturment and computer network settings. Network connections through Viper use cell, wi-fi, and radio communication and synced using Precision Time Management protocols, meaning that through training and troubleshooting I developed a practical knowledge on how to establish and manipulate real time time data flows.

My experience is such that *Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team* management asked me to design and run a training for all TetraTech responders on the contract.

#### East Palistine Train Derailment 

I helped establish and maintain the air monitoring network around the East Palistine Train Derailment.  Because of its size and longevity, this project taught me how to effectively scale air monitoring networks and many telemetry best practices that are not normally considered in emergency conditions.
