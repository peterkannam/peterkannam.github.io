Hello! I am a professional environmental geologist and data scientist working for Tetra Tech. I primarily support the following projects:

- *Chicago Cumulative Impact Assessment; Data and Methods Working Group* for the Chicago Department of Public Health
- *Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team* for Region 5 of the US EPA Region 5
- *Navajo Abandoned Uranium Mines; Response, Assessment, and Evaluation Services* for US EPA Region 9

For an example of my work, I would suggest  [`CompoisteIndicators.jl`](https://github.com/peterkannam/CompositeIndicators.jl): a package I wrote in [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/).
